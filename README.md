# Note-Taking App

A simple note-taking web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows you to create, edit, delete, and store notes using `localStorage` for persistent data. It also simulates asynchronous operations (such as saving/loading notes) using `Promises` with a delay for a realistic experience.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Allows users to create a new note with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can edit the title and content of existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Each note can be deleted.
- **Persistent Data**: Notes are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Asynchronous Saving/Loading**: Simulated delay for saving and loading notes using Promises.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, displaying notes in a 3-column grid on large screens and adjusting to 2 or 1 column on smaller devices.
- **Modal Interface**: A modal window for creating and editing notes for a smooth user experience.
